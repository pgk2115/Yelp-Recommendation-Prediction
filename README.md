# Yelp-Recommendation-Prediction
This project utilizes the Yelp Contest Dataset <https://www.yelp.com/dataset>. Specifically, I used the yelp_review, yelp_user and yelp_business datasets. The objective was first: to perform exploratory analysis on the content of the reviews and business datasets, and second: to build a predictive model that given text will output a target star range.
A recurrent neural network model was used after establishing that more conventional statistical models were inadequate.
